# ENSEMBLE-ON-4-MODELS-IN-R
Ensemble Model in R to deduce if isolated model does better or a combo of models using the loan data to predict if the target variable Loan_Status will be a Yes or a No .
Create 4 models using the caret package in R, these models are Decision tree , Random forest , Knn , GLM .
Predict the accuracy and kappa of each model and calculate each model's probability.
Predict the average of the probability of all four models.
Predict the weighted average of all four models .
Predict the majority voting based on all four models .
Conclude if all four models or an isolated one is most accurate.
